  Let's make programming fun :-)

<h1>Game Rules </h2>
The game majorly challenges you on how fast you can solve questions/algorithms, and that is thinking on the solutions, and as well how fast you can implement the solution. 
<br>
These are the rules
<ul>
<li>
The big play button : This is your timer. it will show a 'loading' animation meaning you still have space to complete the question. The interesting bit here, is that this timer wont show you a count down. this makes the game more interesting. you just know somehow, somewhere teh loader will end, yet you can't just tell when
</li>
<li>
Gained Scores : The more questions you do, the more you cumulated 'gained' scores - think of it as bonus, whether the answer was correct or not. But once the timer is done, and your code is locked, you are at the liberty to restart the timer, just that it reduces your gained scores.
</li>
<li>
Shuffle : If you feel the question is too complex for you shuffle (use the 'roundabout' icon on the top right conner of the editor), you have a count of shuffles tracked for you on the panel, once it reaches 3 shuffles, you can't shuffle any more, until your timer ends
</li>
<li>
Green Button: use the green button to submit and move to the next question</li>
</ul>
